# My take on TicTacToe game

React and styled-components

### **Basic functionality**
- [x] Player can play TicTacToe
- [x] Player can choose X or O
- [x] The Game resets after end

### **How to play**
1. Copy this repository to your local machine
2. Run `dist/index.html` in browser

### **How to change**
Assuming `node` and `npm` installed on your computer

Copy this repository

Run `npm i` to install dependencies

Scripts:

`npm start` - webpack watches for changes / no browser autorefresh

`npm run build` - webpack builds with `NODE_ENV` set to `production`

### **TODO**
- _Minimax_ algorithm (currently random)
- Save to _localStorage_
- Multiplayer
